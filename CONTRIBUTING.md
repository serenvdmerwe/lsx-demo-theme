# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to LightSpeed! Please follow this workflow to help us maintain a high-quality, consistent codebase and community.

## Ideal Contribution Workflow

### 1. Start with the GitHub Issue

-   Use the appropriate [issue template](https://github.com/lightspeedwp/REPONAME/issues/new/choose) for bug reports, enhancements, or questions.
-   Clearly describe the problem, feature, or task. Include as much detail as possible (steps to reproduce, expected behavior, environment, etc.).
-   Discuss your intended approach in the issue before starting work, if needed.

### 2. Create a Branch

-   Use a descriptive branch name, such as `feature/short-description`, `bugfix/short-description`, or `chore/short-description`.

### 3. Develop Your Solution

-   Follow the coding standards and style guides used in this repository. If a linter or formatter is configured (e.g., ESLint, Prettier, PHPCS), ensure your code passes all checks before submitting.
-   Write clear, concise commit messages.

### 4. Create a Pull Request (PR)

-   Open a PR from your branch to the appropriate base branch (e.g., `trunk` or `trunk 2.1`).
-   **All PRs must have a description.** Make sure the description is accurate and updated if changes are made.
-   **All PRs must include a link to the related GitHub Issue in the description.** If a ticket does not exist, please create one.
-   **All PRs must include information on how the change can be tested.** Provide a detailed list of steps or a video demonstration.
-   **All PRs must contain screenshot(s) of any UI changes.** Add screenshots in the PR details and update them as needed in comments.
-   **Tests should not be skipped!** If you must skip a test, provide your justification.
-   **PRs with module version bumps should have a link to the release notes and a summary of notable changes.**
-   **Any PR that doesn't meet the criteria in this list should be converted to a draft PR until it is ready to go.**

### 5. Review Process

-   PRs will be reviewed by maintainers, Copilot, or designated reviewers. For simple tasks, Copilot review may be sufficient and a maintainer review may not be required.
-   Be responsive to feedback and make requested changes as needed.
-   Only maintainers can approve and merge PRs.

### 6. Merge

-   Once your PR is approved and all checks pass, it can be merged into the base branch.

## Additional Guidelines

-   **Use [Saved Replies](./SAVED_REPLIES.md) for common responses.** Reviewers and maintainers are encouraged to use or adapt the saved replies for consistent and efficient communication.
-   All PRs must pass automated tests and checks before being merged. Please review any CI failures and address them promptly.
