# ðŸŽ¨ Styles Folder Guide

This folder contains block styles and variations that extend the core WordPress blocks.

## Purpose
The `styles/` directory contains custom block styles and variations that complement the `theme.json` configuration.

## Guidelines
- Block styles should use theme.json tokens for consistency
- Focus on reusability and accessibility
- Document style variations with comments
- Test styles across different viewports

## Block Styles vs. Variations
- **Block Styles**: Visual variants of a block (different appearances)
- **Block Variations**: Functional variants with different attributes or defaults

## Registration
Register styles in a structured way:
```php
register_block_style(
    'core/paragraph',
    [
        'name'  => 'lsx-feature',
        'label' => __('Feature Text', 'lsx-theme'),
    ]
);
```

## Naming Conventions
- Use the `lsx-` prefix for all custom styles
- Keep names descriptive and semantic
- Use kebab-case for style names

## Testing
Test all style variations:
- In the editor
- On the frontend
- Across different themes
- On mobile devices

## Integration with theme.json
- Ensure custom styles complement theme.json settings
- Reference color palette and typography settings from theme.json
- Use spacing tokens consistently
