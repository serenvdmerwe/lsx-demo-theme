-->

## Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or later)
-   npm (v9 or later)
-   WordPress (latest version)
-   WordPress Studio or a local WordPress development environment

<!--
Reference: Ensure all prerequisites are installed before proceeding. Node.js and npm are required for build tooling; Composer is optional for PHP linting.
-->

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

````bash
    git clone https://github.com/lightspeedwp/lsx-demo-theme.git
    cd lsx-demo-theme
    ```

2. Install Node.js dependencies:


```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Install PHP dependencies (optional, for linting):


```bash
    composer install
    ```

4. Setup Husky git hooks:


```bash
    npm run prepare
    ```

5. Install Playwright browsers for testing:
    ```bash
    npx playwright install
    ```

<!--
Reference: Each installation step is required for a fully functional local development environment. Playwright is used for E2E and accessibility testing.
-->

### VS Code Setup

1. **Install recommended extensions**: VS Code will prompt you to install the extensions listed in `.vscode/extensions.json`
2. **Review configuration**: Check `.vscode/README.md` for detailed setup instructions
3. **Configure Copilot**: The workspace includes enhanced AI assistance via:
    - **Agent Configuration**: `.vscode/agent.json` for WordPress-specific AI help
    - **Development Guidelines**: `.vscode/configuration.md` for best practices
    - **MCP Integration**: `.vscode/mcp.json` for enhanced Copilot features

<!--
Reference: VS Code configuration files provide AI-enhanced development and enforce coding standards. Review these files for optimal setup.

## Development Workflow

### Building Assets

- Start development mode with hot reloading:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

- Build for production:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

### Code Quality

- Lint JavaScript:

    ```bash
    npm run lint:js
    ```

- Lint CSS:

    ```bash
    npm run lint:css
    ```

- Lint PHP (requires Composer):

    ```bash
    npm run lint:php
    ```

- Format code:
    ```bash
    npm run format
    ```

### Testing

- Run all tests (Playwright):

    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

- Run accessibility tests only:

    ```bash
    npm run test:a11y
    ```

- Run end-to-end tests with UI:

    ```bash
    npx playwright test --ui
    ```

- Install Playwright browsers:
    ```bash
    npx playwright install
    ```

<!--
Reference: Playwright is used for E2E and accessibility testing. All test commands are validated for the project setup.

## WordPress Integration

### Using WordPress Studio

1. Create a new site on WordPress Studio
2. Connect your local repository to the site
3. Use Studio's sync feature to push changes to the live site

### Using Local WordPress

If you're using a local WordPress setup:

1. Make sure your WordPress installation points to this theme directory
2. Activate the theme in the WordPress admin
3. Make changes locally and see them reflected in your local WordPress instance

<!--
Reference: Both WordPress Studio and local setups are supported. Follow the steps for your preferred environment.

# Run with UI for debugging
npx playwright test --ui

# Run accessibility tests only
npm run test:a11y

# Generate test report
npx playwright show-report
```

### Accessibility Testing

-   **Automated**: Playwright tests include axe-core accessibility checks
-   **Manual**: Test with screen readers, keyboard navigation

    ```

2. Make your changes following WordPress standards:

    ```bash
    # Test your changes
    npm test
    npm run lint:js
    npm run lint:css

    # Commit with conventional format
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: add new hero pattern with accessibility improvements"
    ```

3. Push and create a pull request:

    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```

4. **Pull Request Requirements:**
    - Reference related issues (#123)
    - Include screenshots for UI changes
    - Ensure all tests pass
