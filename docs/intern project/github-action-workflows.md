## Automate PR Labeling with GitHub Actions

To streamline project management, you can add a **Pull Request labeler** action. This will automatically tag PRs based on which files were changed, saving you the hassle of manual labeling. GitHub provides an official action **actions/labeler** for this [**github.com**](https://github.com/actions/labeler#:~:text=Create%20a%20workflow%20%28e.g.%20,the%20labeler%20action%20with%20content).

### Set up the labeler config

In your repository, create a file .github/labeler.yml. In this file, you define label names and the file patterns that should trigger them [**github.com**](https://github.com/actions/labeler#:~:text=Usage) [**github.com**](https://github.com/actions/labeler#:~:text=,file%3A). For example, you might add:


```yaml

Documentation:

- changed-files:

- any-glob-to-any-file: '**/*.md'


PHP:

- changed-files:

- any-glob-to-any-file: '**/*.php'


Templates:

- changed-files:

- any-glob-to-any-file: 'templates/**/*'

```


In the above config:

Any PR that changes one or more Markdown files (*.md) will get the **“Documentation”** label (useful for notes or docs updates) [**github.com**](https://github.com/actions/labeler#:~:text=,file%3A%20%27%2A%2A%2F%2A.md).
Changes in .php files (likely your PHP pattern registrations or functions.php) get a **“PHP”** label, and
Changes to files under the templates/ folder get a **“Templates”** label.
You can customize this list as needed (for instance, a label for CSS changes, etc.). The syntax supports wildcards and even regex for branch names, but basic glob patterns usually suffice.

### Set up the labeler workflow

Next, add a workflow file at .github/workflows/labeler.yml to enable the action. A minimal workflow would be:




```yaml

name: PR Labeler

on: [pull_request_target]

jobs:

label:

runs-on: ubuntu-latest

permissions:

contents: read

pull-requests: write

steps:

- uses: actions/labeler@v5

```




This uses the Labeler action on every Pull Request (including from forks, hence pull_request_target) [**github.com**](https://github.com/actions/labeler#:~:text=name%3A%20,pull_request_target). It needs permissions to read contents and write to PRs (to apply labels). The action will read your labeler.yml config and apply the appropriate labels whenever a PR is opened or updated.

After setting this up, try opening a test Pull Request changing, say, a markdown file – you should see the “Documentation” label appear automatically on the PR. This helps maintainers quickly understand the scope of changes. You can always refine the globs or add new labels as your repository grows.

## Add Continuous Integration: Tests & Linting Workflows

Now that we have tests and coding standards, it’s wise to run them automatically on every push or PR. We can set up two key workflows: one for running your test suite (Playwright), and one for running linters (code quality checks). These will ensure that any code pushed to the repo meets your quality bar.

### Running Tests in CI

Create a workflow file (e.g. .github/workflows/test.yml) to run your Playwright tests on GitHub’s servers. For example:




```yaml

name: CI Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:

test:

runs-on: ubuntu-latest

steps:

- name: Checkout code

uses: actions/checkout@v3:contentReference[oaicite:30]{index=30}

- name: Setup Node.js

uses: actions/setup-node@v3

with:

node-version: '18':contentReference[oaicite:31]{index=31}

- name: Install dependencies

run: npm install:contentReference[oaicite:32]{index=32}

- name: Run Playwright tests

run: npx playwright test --reporter=dot

```




This workflow triggers on pushes and PRs. It checks out your repo, sets up Node 18 (so you have a runtime to execute tests) [**codecademy.com**](https://www.codecademy.com/article/how-to-use-github-actions#:~:text=), installs npm dependencies (ensuring Playwright and axe are installed) [**codecademy.com**](https://www.codecademy.com/article/how-to-use-github-actions#:~:text=run%3A%20npm%20install), then runs the tests. We use Playwright’s CLI to run tests in headless mode; you can choose a reporter or other options as needed.

*Make sure Playwright’s browsers are installed in the CI environment.* One way is to run npx playwright install --with-deps before testing (Playwright has a GitHub Action for this, but a simple run command works too). This ensures Chromium/Firefox/WebKit are available for the tests.

After adding this, when you open a Pull Request, GitHub will automatically run your tests and show a status check (✅/❌) for “CI Tests”. If a test fails (e.g. an accessibility regression), you’ll know before merging.

### Linting with Super-Linter for Code Quality

To keep your code style consistent and catch issues like syntax errors or styling nits, consider using **GitHub Super-Linter** – a GitHub-maintained action that runs a collection of linters for many languages (PHP, JS, CSS, Markdown, etc.) [**github.com**](https://github.com/super-linter/super-linter#:~:text=Super). This is easier than configuring each linter manually.

### Configuration

Super-Linter will automatically detect config files in a .github/linters/ directory by default [**freecodecamp.org**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/github-super-linter/#:~:text=Linters%20often%20use%20configuration%20files,github%2Flinters). You can create that folder and put any configuration files for linters there. For example, you might add:

A .phpcs.xml or .phpcs.xml.dist to configure PHP CodeSniffer (WordPress Coding Standards ruleset) if not already present.
A .stylelintrc.json for CSS linting rules (the LSX theme likely has one you can reuse).
A .eslintrc.json or .eslint.yaml if you plan to lint JavaScript.
A .markdownlint.json for markdown style rules (useful for readme or docs).
If you already have such config files in the root, you can either move them into .github/linters/ or set Super-Linter to look in the root. By default, it looks in .github/linters/ for any known linter configs [**freecodecamp.org**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/github-super-linter/#:~:text=Linters%20often%20use%20configuration%20files,github%2Flinters), so organizing them there is a clean approach.

### Workflow

Add a workflow file .github/workflows/lint.yml with content like:



```yaml

name: Lint Code Base

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:

lint:

runs-on: ubuntu-latest

steps:

- uses: actions/checkout@v3

- name: Run Super-Linter

uses: github/super-linter@v4

env:

DEFAULT_BRANCH: main

GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

# (Optional) VALIDATE_PHP: true   # enable/disable specific linters

# (Optional) LINTER_RULES_PATH: .github/linters

```


This will run the Super Linter action against your code [**freecodecamp.org**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/github-super-linter/#:~:text=,depth%3A%200). By default it will detect all file types and run appropriate linters. The environment variables above: we specify the default branch (needed for annotations) and pass the repo’s token so it can post results. You can also explicitly toggle specific linters via VALIDATE_ variables (e.g., if you want to ensure it runs PHPCS, ESLint, etc., you can set VALIDATE_PHP: true and so on) [**freecodecamp.org**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/github-super-linter/#:~:text=uses%3A%20github%2Fsuper,secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN), but if you omit these, Super-Linter will auto-detect based on file types.

When this runs, it will use the configuration files from .github/linters/ for each linter (for example, your .phpcs.xml or .eslintrc.yml will be picked up) [**freecodecamp.org**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/github-super-linter/#:~:text=Linters%20often%20use%20configuration%20files,github%2Flinters). If any lint errors are found, the action will fail and surface the messages in the log (and as GitHub code annotations). This is a great way to enforce code standards – for instance, it will catch PHP coding standard violations, CSS lint errors, missing newline at EOF, etc., depending on the linters enabled.

### Using Linters

After setting this up, test it by introducing a small mistake (like a PHP file with a syntax error or a styling issue) and pushing to a branch – the **Lint Code Base** job should catch it. You can then fix the issue before merging. Over time, this ensures the repository remains clean and consistent.

## Further Recommendations (Optional)

With the core integration in place (Copilot instructions, prompts, tests, CI workflows), you can further enhance the project with a few more best practices:

### Dependency Management

Enable **Dependabot** version updates for your repo (via GitHub’s Settings > Security > *Dependabot*). This will automatically open PRs to update npm packages (or Composer packages) when new versions come out, helping you keep the theme’s dependencies up to date.

### Security Scans

Consider adding **CodeQL** analysis (GitHub’s code scanning for security vulnerabilities). GitHub can automatically run CodeQL on your PHP/JS code to find known security issues. You can enable this via the Security tab -> Code scanning, and add the generated codeql-analysis.yml workflow. This is particularly useful for a WordPress theme to catch things like using insecure functions, etc.
