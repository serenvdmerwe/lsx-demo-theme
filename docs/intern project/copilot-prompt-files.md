# Creating Reusable Copilot Prompt Files

In addition to general instructions, GitHub Copilot allows **Prompt Files** – these are reusable prompts for common tasks, which you can run in Copilot Chat with a single command [**code.visualstudio.com**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#:~:text=Prompt%20files%20are%20reusable%20prompts,how%20the%20task%20should%20be) [**code.visualstudio.com**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#:~:text=VS%20Code%20supports%20two%20types,of%20scopes%20for%20prompt%20files). Prompt files live in the repository (for workspace-specific prompts) under the .github/prompts/ folder, each with a .prompt.md extension [**code.visualstudio.com**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#:~:text=,folder%20of%20the%20workspace) [**code.visualstudio.com**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#:~:text=,promptFilesLocations%20setting). This is an **experimental feature** (ensure you have the latest Copilot extension and the feature enabled).

### How to add a Prompt File

Create the directory .github/prompts/ in your repo, and inside it add a Markdown file with a descriptive name, ending in .[**prompt.md**](http://prompt.md) [**code.visualstudio.com**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#:~:text=You%20can%20create%20prompt%20files,while%20user%20prompt%20files%20are) [**code.visualstudio.com**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#:~:text=,promptFilesLocations%20setting). For example, you might add a file **code-review.prompt.md** to guide Copilot in reviewing your pull requests, or **generate-pattern.prompt.md** to help scaffold a new block pattern. Each prompt file should describe *the task Copilot should perform* and any context or criteria.

### Structure

A prompt file can be formatted with headings, lists, or code blocks – similar to writing a chat prompt by hand [**code.visualstudio.com**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#:~:text=Prompt%20file%20structure). You can even include links to other files or instructions. For example, you might link to your copilot-instructions or a specific coding guideline so the prompt stays concise [**code.visualstudio.com**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#:~:text=Prompt%20files%20can%20take%20advantage,specific%20instructions%20on%20how%20to) [**code.visualstudio.com**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#:~:text=match%20at%20L819%20You%20can,location%20of%20the%20prompt%20file). Variables are supported (e.g. you can use placeholders like ${workspaceFolder} if needed) [**code.visualstudio.com**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#:~:text=Within%20a%20prompt%20file%2C%20you,can%20reference%20the%20following%20variables), but for most cases a static prompt is fine.

### Example Prompt – Code Review

In code-review.prompt.md, you could write a checklist for reviewing code. For instance: *“Analyze the diff of the pull request for this theme. Check for WordPress coding standards violations, security issues (e.g. unsanitized inputs, unescaped outputs), performance concerns, and adherence to project conventions. Summarize any potential problems in bullet points.”* This prompt, when run, would instruct Copilot to act as a code reviewer following your guidelines.

### Running Prompt Files

In VS Code’s Copilot Chat, you can execute a prompt file by typing / and the file name, or by opening the file and clicking the “Run” ▶️ button [**code.visualstudio.com**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#:~:text=Linux%20Ctrl%2BShift%2BP,file%20from%20the%20Quick%20Pick) [**code.visualstudio.com**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#:~:text=match%20at%20L893%20,open%20a%20new%20chat%20session). For instance, typing /code-review in chat would load the code-review.prompt.md content and run it. This saves time versus typing out the same request repeatedly.

Prompt files are a great way to encapsulate repetitive tasks. You could create prompts for things like *“Generate a PHPUnit test for a given function”*, *“Suggest improvements for accessibility based on theme templates”*, or *“Outline the steps to implement a new feature based on the project structure”*. By storing them in the repo, you and your team can re-use these prompts anytime. (Remember to keep them updated if your project changes.)
