### Pull Request Templates and Issue Templates

Since you already have a structured learning project, you can add PR templates (.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) or additional issue templates to guide contributors. This isn’t an “action”, but it helps maintain consistency in documentation.

Each of these steps will make your repository more robust and maintainable. You can tackle them one by one – for instance, start with the Copilot integration (which will immediately help with AI suggestions), then add tests, then set up the actions. Breaking the work into these modules is a smart approach. Good luck with enhancing the LSX Demo Theme! 🚀
