# **🧠 LightSpeed Mentor Guide**

**Version 1.0**

## **🔰 Overview**

LightSpeed mentors are responsible for onboarding junior developers and guiding them through our 3-month structured training programme. This guide provides clear expectations, mentoring techniques, and progress tracking methods.

---

## **🎯 Goals of Mentoring**

* Reinforce LightSpeed’s technical and cultural standards.

* Ensure trainees become self-sufficient with GitHub, block themes, and plugin dev.

* Help juniors build confidence with daily documentation and reflection.

* Provide review, guidance, and support – not micromanagement.

Mentors should review:

* PRs \+ commit history

* Markdown journals

* GitHub Issues for planning

---

## **🛠️ Tools Mentors Should Use**

* GitHub (issues, branches, PRs)

* Google Sheets: [Mentor Tracking Sheet](https://chatgpt.com/c/68907faf-ca64-8326-91b2-09001d49d6fc#)

* Figma (for design and Dev Mode feedback)

* Slack / Chat for async check-ins

---

## **✅ What Makes a Good Check-In?**

* Ask: What was the highlight of your work this week?

* Check: GitHub activity (issues, commits, PRs)

* Reflect: What blockers came up?

* Guide: Suggest new topics or reframe confusion

* Push: Assign next task via GitHub Issue

---

## **🚨 Red Flags to Watch**

* No markdown journal updates

* Missed check-ins or unclear progress

* PRs without descriptions or review requests

* Avoidance of GitHub workflows

* Lack of effort to resolve problems independently

---

## **🙌 Feedback Principles**

* Be kind, direct, and constructive

* Praise effort, not just results

* Document learning moments (copy snippets, PR links)

* Align feedback with the training curriculum
