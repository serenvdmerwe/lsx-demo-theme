# Frequently Asked Questions

This FAQ addresses some of the common questions interns have during the LSX Demo Theme onboarding. If your question isn’t answered here, open a discussion or raise an issue.

### What are the expected working hours?

Interns are expected to commit **40 hours per week**. The internship is remote and asynchronous, so you can arrange your hours as long as you meet deadlines and attend scheduled check‑ins. Communicate availability clearly in your weekly plan.

### How should I track my time?

We recommend using the **Harvest** time tracking extension or website. Start a timer when you begin work on a GitHub issue or task, and write a concise description of what you’re doing. At the end of the day, copy each time entry’s description into your log file (e.g. `logs/week-01.md`) along with the hours spent. This creates a transparent record of your work.

### How do I submit my weekly work?

At the end of each week, open a **Week X Submission** issue using the provided template. Summarise what you worked on, link to Pull Requests, describe any challenges and reflect on what you learned. Keep your log files in the `logs/` folder up to date and push them before creating the submission issue.

### Should I create GitHub issues for every task?

Yes. Create an issue for each significant task or learning objective. Use the appropriate issue template (general task, week plan, template parts, etc.) to ensure all necessary information is captured. This helps the team understand your progress and provides a clear record for time tracking and code reviews.

### Where can I find learning materials?

Refer to `docs/resources.md` for links to official documentation and tutorials on LocalWP, GitHub, WordPress block themes, Copilot, Figma and testing. Each week’s topics also list relevant resources in `docs/curriculum.md`.

### What if I’m stuck or need help?

Being stuck is part of learning. First, search the documentation and resources. If you’re still blocked, describe your problem in detail and ask for help via a GitHub issue or the team’s communication channel. When you seek help, include links to relevant code, commits or error messages.

### How often should I commit?

Commit early and often. Small, incremental commits with clear messages are easier to review and troubleshoot. Use branches for new features or experiments and open Pull Requests when ready. Daily commits are encouraged to ensure your work is visible.

### What goes into the reflection log?

The `logs/reflections.md` file is used for broader reflections on the entire internship. Use it to record insights about what you’ve learned, challenges you overcame, what tools or workflows you found most effective and how you plan to continue improving. Reflective writing helps consolidate knowledge and demonstrates growth.
