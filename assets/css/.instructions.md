# ðŸŽ¨ CSS Folder Guide

This folder contains stylesheets that complement `theme.json` configuration.

## CSS Methodology
- Prefer using `theme.json` tokens for spacing, typography, and colours.
- Use CSS variables for consistency: `var(--wp--preset--color--primary)`
- Follow BEM (Block Element Modifier) or utility-first naming conventions
- Minimize custom CSS in favor of theme.json settings

## Overrides
- Custom CSS should only be used when theme.json settings are insufficient
- Document why custom CSS was necessary in code comments
- Organize by component or template when possible

## Asset Optimization
- Use WebP format for images
- Optimize SVGs using tools like SVGO
- Compress CSS for production

## Linting
Lint your styles using `npm run lint:css`

## Design Tokens
Reference Figma design system tokens and ensure matching class names and properties.

## Accessibility
- Ensure sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA minimum)
- Test with keyboard navigation
- Verify styles work with screen readers
- Support reduced motion preferences

## Responsive Design
- Use theme.json responsive settings where possible
- Follow mobile-first approach
- Test on multiple devices and viewport sizes
- Ensure touch targets are at least 44x44px on mobile
