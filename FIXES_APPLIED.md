# Designer Boot Template Fixes Applied

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Gallery Not Displaying Images

**Problem**: Additional image URLs from meta boxes (lbc_image_2, lbc_image_3, lbc_image_4) were not appearing in the gallery section.

**Root Cause**: The `lbc_render_gallery()` function expected an array of attachment IDs, but our meta boxes store individual image URLs.

**Solution Applied**:

-   Updated `lbc_render_gallery()` function to collect images from individual meta fields (lbc_image_2, lbc_image_3, lbc_image_4)
-   Modified shortcode processing to pass `$post_id` instead of non-existent `lbc_gallery` field value
-   Gallery now renders images with proper styling and alt text

### 2. Featured Image Layout Issue

**Problem**: Featured image was pushing down the boot details section on the right column, creating a large gap.

**Root Cause**: Column alignment and flex behavior wasn't properly constraining the featured image container.

**Solution Applied**:

-   Added CSS rules to ensure columns align to `flex-start`
-   Added specific styling for `.single-designer_boot` template
-   Enhanced featured image container styling to prevent layout disruption

## Files Modified

### 1. `/inc/designer-boot-template-helpers.php`

-   **Function**: `lbc_render_gallery()` - Completely rewritten to handle individual image URL fields
-   **Shortcode Processing**: Updated `[lbc_gallery]` to pass post ID instead of field value
-   **Gallery Output**: Now renders proper grid layout with individual images

### 2. `/assets/css/designer-boots.css`

-   **Layout Fixes**: Added column alignment rules for single boot template
-   **Gallery Styling**: Enhanced gallery grid with proper spacing and hover effects
-   **Featured Image**: Added constraints to prevent layout issues

### 3. `/templates/single-designer_boot.html`

-   **Heel Height**: Fixed double "mm" display in details section

## Expected Results

### Gallery Section

-   Now displays all additional images (Image 2, 3, 4) from meta boxes
-   Images appear in a responsive grid layout
-   Hover effects and proper styling applied
-   Alt text from meta boxes is used for accessibility
-   Shows "No additional images available" when no images are set

### Layout Section

-   Featured image no longer affects right column positioning
-   Two-column layout maintains proper alignment
-   Boot details section appears correctly aligned with featured image
-   Responsive behavior maintained

### Admin Interface

-   Meta boxes continue to work as before
-   Images saved as individual URLs in lbc_image_2, lbc_image_3, lbc_image_4 fields
-   Alt text fields saved and used in front-end display

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Visit Single Boot Page**: Go to any designer boot URL (e.g., `/designer-boots/gucci-horsebit-ankle-boot-black-calfskin/`)
2. **Check Layout**: Verify featured image and boot details align properly
3. **Test Gallery**: Add image URLs to "Additional Images" meta box and verify they display
4. **Test Responsiveness**: Check layout on mobile devices
5. **Verify Custom Fields**: Ensure all custom fields display correctly in details section
