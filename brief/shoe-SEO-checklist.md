* Internal linking:

  * **Blog → Products/Shop/About**

  * **Products ↔ Related products** (same heel type/material)

  * **About → Contact/Shop**

---

## **3\. Structure & readability**

* Short paragraphs (2–3 sentences), scannable H2/H3.

* Yoast readability: aim **green**, but don’t over-optimise.

* **ZA English**, active voice, warm luxury tone; 8–18 word sentences.

---

* Use **FAQ blocks** for long-tail/voice search.

---

## **5\. Images & media**

* Filenames: `black-stiletto-ankle-boot-calfskin-side.jpg`.

* Compress (maintain quality); generate **WebP** sources; lazy-load.

* Captions only when helpful (materials, fit).

* Structured galleries with descriptive alt per frame.

---

## **6\. Ongoing**

* Review Yoast analysis on each publish/update.

* Refresh cornerstone posts quarterly (keep recency).

* Content cadence: **2 posts/month** minimum (care, styling, materials).

---

## **7\. Internal Links**

* Build **pillar → cluster**:

  * Pillar: *Luxury Black Heels Guide*

  * Clusters: care, styling, fit, materials, heel types.

* Ensure **no dead-ends**: every page links forward to a next best action.

* Use **related products** powered by taxonomies (Heel Type, Material, Collection).

---

## **8\. Outgoing Links**

* Cite **high-authority** sources (fashion editorials, materials standards, reputable magazines).

* Keep links topically aligned; open in same tab unless a tool/download.

* Re-audit external links every 6 months.

---

## **9\. Anchor Text**

* Descriptive, concise anchors:

  * Good: *polished calfskin care guide*

  * Avoid: *click here* / over-long sentences as links.

* Only link terms that match the destination’s primary topic.

---

## **10\. HTTPS (Secure Browsing)**

---

## **11\. Mobile-Friendliness**

* Buttons: **≥44×44px**; forms clear and thumb-friendly.

* Use Google **Mobile-Friendly Test** & **PageSpeed Insights**; optimise tap targets and font sizes.

---

## **12\. Synonyms and Clear Themes**

* Write around **intent-led themes**: luxury, craftsmanship, materials, fit, care.

* Use natural synonyms: **heels, stilettos, pumps**, **calfskin/leather**, **elegant/polished/timeless**.

* Avoid repetition; prefer semantically related phrasing.

---

## **13\. Conversational tone**

* Optimise for voice: include **questions** \+ succinct answers (FAQ).
