# Week 02 Log and Reflection

## Weekly Reflection

### What went well?

This week, I completed several Microsoft and GitHub courses, which helped me deepen my understanding of repository management, GitHub Copilot, and best practices for maintaining secure repositories. Collaborating with Seren was a highlight, as we were able to plan and divide tasks for the lsx-demo-theme project effectively. Resolving the GitHub billing issue was also a success, ensuring my account was fully functional.

### What can be improved?

The GitHub billing issue caused a slight delay in progress, but it was resolved quickly. I could improve my workflow by allocating more time for reading and processing the learning material from forums. Additionally, I should aim to streamline email management to save time.

### What have you learned?

I learned how to use advanced GitHub Copilot features, manage repositories effectively, and maintain secure repositories. The forums provided valuable insights into best practices for WordPress themes and GitHub workflows. Collaborating with Seren also taught me the importance of teamwork and task division.

### What are your next actions?

-   Continue working on the lsx-demo-theme project and implement the next steps.
-   Explore additional forums and resources to deepen my understanding of WordPress themes.
-   Plan Week 3 tasks with Seren and ensure steady progress.
-   Take more advanced courses on GitHub and WordPress development.
