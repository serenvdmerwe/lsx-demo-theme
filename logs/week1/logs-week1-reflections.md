# Week 01 Log and Reflection

## Weekly Reflection

### What went well?

This week, I successfully set up all required profiles and accounts, which exposed me to various communities and learning resources. I also completed multiple GitHub courses and made significant progress on the Block Theme Academy course. Setting up Local Ollie and LSX-Demo Site went smoothly, and I’m proud of the progress I made in understanding block themes.

### What can be improved?

The Block Theme Academy course required more time and focus than I initially anticipated. I could improve my time management by allocating more focused blocks of time for complex tasks. Additionally, I could streamline the process of taking notes to make it more efficient.

### What have you learned?

I learned how to set up and secure various accounts, work with Local Ollie and LSX-Demo Site, and navigate the Block Theme Academy course. The GitHub courses introduced me to new workflows and tools, including GitHub Copilot and MCP integration.

### What are your next actions?

-   Continue exploring advanced topics in block themes.
-   Start applying the knowledge gained from GitHub courses to real-world tasks.
-   Plan and prioritize tasks for Week 2 to ensure steady progress.
-   Explore additional resources and communities to deepen my understanding of WordPress themes.
