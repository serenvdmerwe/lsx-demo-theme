# Week 03 Log and Reflection

## Weekly Reflection

### What went well?

This week was incredibly productive and insightful. I learned a lot about AI and GitHub Copilot, which has been fascinating. Collaborating with Seren has been a highlight, as we worked well together to finalize planning approaches and delegate tasks effectively. The 5-hour session with Ash about the website project was a significant milestone, and I’m excited to start applying what I’ve learned. Adding the `changelog.md` file and Epic ISSUE TEMPLATE to the repository was another success.

### What can be improved?

While the week was productive, the 5-hour session with Ash left me feeling a bit tired, which reduced my focus for the rest of the day. I could improve by managing my energy better during long sessions. Additionally, I need to allocate more time for in-depth reviews of repositories and documentation to ensure I fully understand them before incorporating them into projects.

### What have you learned?

I’ve deepened my understanding of GitHub Copilot and its applications, particularly through the `awesome-copilot` repository. The session with Ash provided valuable insights into the website project, and I learned how to approach it systematically. Collaborating with Seren has reinforced the importance of teamwork and effective task delegation.

### What are your next actions?

-   Continue working on the website project and apply the knowledge gained from the session with Ash.
-   Incorporate relevant files from the `awesome-copilot` repository into the lsx-demo-theme project.
-   Plan Week 4 tasks with Seren and ensure steady progress.
-   Allocate time for further learning and exploring advanced GitHub Copilot features.
