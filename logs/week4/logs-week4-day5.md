-   Re-formatted the tabs in the Website Structure document.
-   Made final updates to my website brief in the docs.
-   Exported 16 tabs from my document into .md format to use as instructions for Copilot agent/spaces. Edited and added them to my repo.
-   Used the new .md instruction files as guidelines, along with the WordPress block theme spaces in lightspeed, to prompt Copilot to start the tasks. Experienced and resolved some errors during this process and had to re-run some jobs.
-   Attended a meeting with Ash, Seren, Zared, and Warick regarding the incredible prompting Zared developed.
-   Had a catch-up meeting with Seren.
