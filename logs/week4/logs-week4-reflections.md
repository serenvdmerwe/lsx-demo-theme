# Week 04 Log and Reflection

## Weekly Reflection

### What went well?

This week was marked by steady progress and a deepening understanding of GitHub Copilot Spaces, custom instructions, and workflow integration. Each day brought its own set of accomplishments, including refining documentation, preparing and exporting instructional files, and collaborating with the team. Working closely with Seren, Ash, Zared, and Warick was valuable for both technical growth and team synergy. Resolving setup issues, updating the website brief, and experimenting with Copilot guidance led to more productive and enjoyable work sessions. Meetings about prompting strategies were especially insightful and contributed to improved project direction.

### What can be improved?

While overall productivity was strong, there were minor workflow interruptions caused by file configuration errors (.gitattributes and .gitignore). Although these were resolved quickly, a more thorough review before running processes could help prevent such errors. Additionally, balancing meeting times and focused work blocks could optimize output and reduce context switching.

### What have you learned?

This week solidified my grasp of how to leverage Copilot Spaces and custom instructions effectively. I gained firsthand experience in preparing AI-ready documentation, troubleshooting integration errors, and orchestrating multi-step prompts for Copilot. Through meetings and collaborative work, I also learned new prompting techniques and approaches to instruction design that will be useful for future projects. Overall, my confidence in using Copilot for complex workflows has grown significantly.

### What are your next actions?

-   Continue refining and expanding the Copilot instruction set and documentation.
-   Apply improved prompting strategies learned from team discussions to new tasks.
-   Further automate the integration of instructional files and streamline error handling.
-   Plan for deeper dives into advanced Copilot features and experiment with chat modes for more tailored AI assistance.
-   Maintain regular team check-ins while protecting blocks of uninterrupted work time to maximize productivity.
