# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to LightSpeed! Please follow this workflow to help us maintain a high-quality, consistent codebase and community.

## Ideal Contribution Workflow

### 1. Start with the GitHub Issue
- Use the appropriate [issue template](../../issues/new/choose) for bug reports, enhancements, or questions.
- Clearly describe the problem, feature, or task. Include as much detail as possible (steps to reproduce, expected behavior, environment, etc.).
- Discuss your intended approach in the issue before starting work, if needed.

### 2. Create a Branch
- Use a descriptive branch name, such as `feature/short-description`, `bugfix/short-description`, or `chore/short-description`.

### 3. Develop Your Solution
- Follow the coding standards and style guides used in this repository. If a linter or formatter is configured (e.g., ESLint, Prettier, PHPCS), ensure your code passes all checks before submitting.
- Use **[CodeRabbit.ai](https://coderabbit.ai/)** alongside your local tools to perform automated code reviews and identify issues early.
- Write clear, concise commit messages (e.g., Conventional Commits: feat:, fix:, docs:, chore:, refactor:).
- Open a PR from your branch to the appropriate base branch (e.g., `trunk` or `trunk 2.1`).
- **All PRs must have a description.** Make sure the description is accurate and updated if changes are made.
- **All PRs must include a link to the related GitHub Issue in the description.** If a ticket does not exist, please create one.
- Open a PR from your branch to the appropriate base branch (e.g., `main` or `release/2.1`).- **All PRs must contain screenshot(s) of any UI changes.** Add screenshots in the PR details and update them as needed in comments.
- **Tests should not be skipped!** If you must skip a test, provide your justification.
- **PRs with module version bumps should have a link to the release notes and a summary of notable changes.**
- **Any PR that doesn't meet the criteria in this list should be converted to a draft PR until it is ready to go.**

- **No new failing or flaky tests.** If a test must be skipped, document the reason and linked issue, and add an unblock date.
- **Do not commit or paste secrets.** Run secret scanning locally before opening a PR.
- **PRs with module version bumps should have a link to the release notes and a summary of notable changes.**
- **Any PR that doesn't meet the criteria in this list should be converted to a draft PR until it is ready to go.**- Be responsive to feedback and make requested changes as needed.
- Only maintainers can approve and merge PRs.
- PRs will be reviewed by **maintainers**. Automated tools (e.g., **CodeRabbit.ai**, Copilot) may assist with feedback, but human maintainers provide approvals.
  **CodeRabbit.ai** runs pre‑review automated checks for quality, performance, and best practices.
- Be responsive to feedback and make requested changes as needed.
- Only maintainers can approve and merge PRs.---

## Additional Guidelines

- **Use [Saved Replies](../SAVED_REPLIES.md) for common responses.** Reviewers and maintainers are encouraged to use or adapt the saved replies for consistent and efficient communication.
- All PRs must pass automated tests and checks (including **CodeRabbit.ai analysis**) before being merged. Please review any CI failures and address them promptly.
