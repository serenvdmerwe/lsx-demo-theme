# Block Pattern Development Instructions

## Pattern Structure

-   Use descriptive comments to document each section of the pattern.
-   Follow a logical structure with clear parent-child relationships.
-   Group related blocks using the Group block where appropriate.
-   Use appropriate block variations based on content needs.
-   Test pattern across different viewport sizes.

## Registration

-   Register patterns using the `register_block_pattern()` function.
-   Use consistent naming with the format: `lsx/[category]-[name]`.
-   Provide meaningful category and keywords for pattern discovery.
-   Set appropriate viewportWidth based on the pattern's design.
-   Include a descriptive title and description for the pattern library.

### Advanced Pattern Assignment

You can assign patterns to specific templates, post types, and block types using pattern file headers:

-   **Assign to Post Types:**
    -   Add a `Post Types:` header (comma-separated) to make a pattern available for specific post types (e.g., `Post Types: page, post`).
-   **Assign to Block Types:**
    -   Add a `Block Types:` header (e.g., `Block Types: core/post-content`) to make a pattern available for a specific block context (such as starter page patterns).
-   **Assign to Template Types:**
    -   Add a `Template Types:` header (comma-separated) to associate a pattern with specific templates (e.g., `Template Types: front-page, home`).
    -   Optionally, add `Inserter: no` to hide the pattern from the inserter and only show it in the template creation modal.

#### Example: Starter Page Pattern

```php
/**
 * Title: Example Page
 * Slug: yourtheme/example-page
 * Categories: page
 * Block Types: core/post-content
 * Post Types: page
 * Viewport width: 1376
 */
```

#### Example: Template Pattern

```php
/**
 * Title: Home Template
 * Slug: yourtheme/home-template
 * Template Types: front-page, home
 * Viewport width: 1376
 * Inserter: no
 */
```

#### Supported Template Types

Common values for `Template Types:` include: `index`, `home`, `front-page`, `singular`, `single`, `page`, `archive`, `author`, `category`, `taxonomy`, `date`, `tag`, `attachment`, `search`, `privacy-policy`, `404`.

### Usage in Templates and Template Parts

-   You can include a pattern directly in a template or template part using the `wp:pattern` block:
    ```html
    <!-- wp:pattern {"slug":"yourtheme/home-template"} /-->
    ```
-   This allows you to reuse patterns across templates and template parts, reducing duplication and improving maintainability.

## Content Strategy

-   Create patterns with placeholder content that makes sense.
-   Use realistic example text rather than lorem ipsum where possible.
-   Provide guidance for customization in pattern comments.
-   Consider different use cases and content variations.
-   Ensure patterns maintain their design integrity when content changes.

## Styling

-   Use theme.json variables exclusively for colors, typography, and spacing.
-   Avoid inline styles or custom CSS within patterns.
-   Apply consistent spacing throughout the pattern.
-   Use predefined block styles rather than custom styles when available.
-   Test patterns with different color schemes (light/dark).

## Accessibility

-   Maintain proper heading hierarchy within patterns.
-   Provide alt text placeholders for all images.
-   Ensure sufficient color contrast for text elements.
-   Make interactive elements keyboard accessible.
-   Test patterns with screen readers.

## Performance

-   Optimize image usage within patterns.
-   Avoid unnecessary nesting of blocks.
-   Keep markup clean and minimal.
-   Consider the performance impact of complex patterns.
-   Test rendering performance on various devices.

## Reusability

-   Design patterns to be reusable across different contexts.
-   Create variations of patterns for different use cases when appropriate.
-   Document pattern dependencies or requirements.
-   Consider how patterns will work with different themes.
-   Test patterns in various page templates and contexts.
