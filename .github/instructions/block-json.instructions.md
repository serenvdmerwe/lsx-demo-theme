# block.json Instructions

## Essentials
- `name`, `title`, `description`, `category`, `keywords`, `supports`.
- Accessibility: clear `title`/`description`; limit complexity in controls.

## Attributes
- Validate and sanitize on save; provide reasonable defaults.
- Use `usesInnerBlocks` and `templateLock` appropriately.

## Variations/Transforms
- Define common starting points; ensure i18n and RTL safety.
