# LightSpeed Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
As contributors and maintainers of LightSpeed and the [lightspeedwp](https://github.com/lightspeedwp) GitHub organization, we pledge to foster a welcoming, respectful, and harassment-free environment for everyone.  
We are committed to an open, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community, consistent with the [WordPress Community Code of Conduct](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/code-of-conduct/).

This means participation is free of discrimination regardless of age, body size, disability (visible or invisible), ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

## Our Standards
### Positive behaviors
- Use welcoming and inclusive language  
- Show empathy and kindness toward others  
- Respect differing viewpoints and experiences  
- Accept and give constructive feedback gracefully  
- Focus on what benefits the community as a whole  

### Unacceptable behaviors
- Sexualized language or imagery; unwelcome sexual attention  
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, or personal/political attacks  
- Public or private harassment  
- Publishing others’ private information (e.g., addresses) without explicit permission  
- Other conduct that would reasonably be deemed inappropriate in a professional setting  

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers and community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards.  
They may remove, edit, or reject contributions (code, comments, issues, etc.) that do not align with this Code of Conduct, and will explain moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all LightSpeed and lightspeedwp community spaces — GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, and communication channels.  
It also applies when representing LightSpeed in public spaces, such as using an official email, social media account, or speaking at events.

## Reporting & Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to LightSpeed community leaders at [support@lightspeedwp.agency](mailto:support@lightspeedwp.agency).  
Reports will be handled promptly, fairly, and confidentially. The privacy and security of reporters will always be respected.

## Enforcement Guidelines
To ensure consistent outcomes, community leaders will use the following ladder of consequences:

1. **Correction**  
   *Impact*: Minor, unprofessional or unwelcome behavior.  
   *Consequence*: Private written warning with clarification. A public apology may be requested.

2. **Warning**  
   *Impact*: A violation through one or multiple incidents.  
   *Consequence*: Warning with terms for continued participation. Violating terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

3. **Temporary Ban**  
   *Impact*: Serious violation, sustained inappropriate behavior.  
   *Consequence*: Temporary ban from interaction and communication with the community.

4. **Permanent Ban**  
   *Impact*: Repeated violations, harassment, or aggression.  
   *Consequence*: Permanent removal from the community.
