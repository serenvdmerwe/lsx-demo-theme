## Creating New Prompts

When creating new prompts for this directory, please follow these guidelines:

2. Include a YAML frontmatter with `mode` and `description` fields
3. Structure the prompt with clear instructions
4. Update this README to include the new prompt

## Maintaining Prompts

These prompts should evolve as our project standards and requirements change. When updating:

1. Make sure changes align with our project guidelines
2. Test the updated prompt with GitHub Copilot before committing
3. Consider backward compatibility with existing code
4. Document significant changes in the commit message
