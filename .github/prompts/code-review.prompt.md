Act as a code reviewer for a WordPress block theme PR:
- Check for adherence to WordPress Coding Standards (PHP and markup)
- Ensure naming follows conventions (e.g. snake_case for PHP functions)
- Suggest using core blocks when possible
- Note any code repetition or maintainability concerns
- Provide feedback in bullet points
