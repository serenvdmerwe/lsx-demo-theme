## Priority
<!-- Select the priority level for this EPIC. -->
- High

## Goal
<!-- Clearly describe the overall goal or objective of this EPIC. What are you trying to achieve? -->
Establish the complete folder and file structure for the WordPress block theme according to WordPress best practices and standards, creating a solid foundation for theme development.

## Description
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the EPIC. Include any relevant context, background, or links to documentation. -->
This epic covers the creation of all necessary folders and files required for a modern WordPress block theme that follows the Full Site Editing (FSE) approach. We will implement the standard theme structure as outlined in the WordPress Block Theme Structure & Development Guidelines, including required core files, primary theme directories, global styles, and proper asset organization.

The theme will follow WordPress coding standards and best practices for block themes, ensuring it's well-structured, maintainable, and ready for development. This foundation will establish the framework upon which all theme features and functionality will be built.
