# ðŸ¤– WordPress-Focused Agents

Specialized GitHub Copilot agents designed for WordPress development workflows, each focusing on specific domains like accessibility, performance, security, and block/theme development.
### How to Use WordPress Agents

**To Reference:**

- Agents complement the global behavioral contract defined in [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md)
- Use agents as reference for specialized WordPress workflows and best practices

**To Create New Agents:**
- Copy the [`TEMPLATE.agent.md`](TEMPLATE.agent.md) file to create new specialized agents

- Ensure new agents align with WordPress coding standards and security practices
