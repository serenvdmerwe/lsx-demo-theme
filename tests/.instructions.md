# ðŸ§ª Tests Folder Instructions

Welcome to the `tests/` directory! Here's how to contribute tests for the LSX Demo Theme.

## Testing Framework
We use [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for end-to-end and accessibility testing.

## Getting Started
- Install dependencies with `npm install`
- Run tests: `npx playwright test`
- Run specific test: `npx playwright test tests/accessibility.spec.ts`

## Directory Structure
```
tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ accessibility/ - Accessibility tests
â”œâ”€â”€ e2e/ - End-to-end tests
â”œâ”€â”€ visual/ - Visual regression tests
â””â”€â”€ fixtures/ - Test data and utilities
```

## Write Your First Test
Tests follow this pattern:
```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('homepage has correct title', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/LSX Demo Theme/);
});
```

## Accessibility Testing
Use Playwright's accessibility assertions:
```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('page has no accessibility violations', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  await expect(page).toHaveNoViolations();
});
```

## Test Coverage
Aim to cover:
- Critical user flows
- Block patterns rendering correctly
- Responsive behavior
- Accessibility compliance
- Theme customization options

## Best Practices
- Keep tests independent (no interdependencies)
- Use descriptive test names
- Group related tests
- Mock external services when necessary
- Use fixtures for test data

## Testing Block Patterns
When testing block patterns:
- Verify they render correctly
- Check responsive behavior
- Validate accessibility
- Test interactivity (if applicable)

## CI Integration
Tests run automatically on GitHub Actions:
- On pull requests to main branch
- Nightly for regression testing

## Debugging Tests
- Use `await page.pause()` to debug interactively
- Run with `--debug` flag for verbose output
- Check screenshots in the test-results directory
